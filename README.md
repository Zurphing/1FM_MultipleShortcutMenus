# 1FM_MultipleShortcutMenus
More shortcut menus, but now on KH1FM.


VERY early version of it. </br>
Still need to check if: </br>
Adding item support is possible </br>
If the "Unused" Save Data area is actually unused</br>
Better way to "Zero" out commands. Blank command is 0xFF in this game, not 0x00
